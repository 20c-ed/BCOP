# BCOP - eBGP Configuration

This BCOP aims to provide a singular, consistent view of industry standard eBGP interconnection methodologies focusing on pre and post turn-up validation practices and IRR Etiquette with goal of sharing eBGP KNOW-HOW.

We (the GNEC) have made many mistakes with IPv4 Peering and Transit configurations and operational practices. As the turn-up of E-BGP sessions with peers and transit providers is a part of daily life, there is an opportunity to do things right from the beginning. While the details of these peering and transit relationships can be varied and specific, the technical realities remain largely the same. These technical realities inform the best practices listed here.

Next Steps:
* Flesh out BCOP content
* Add config examples (in separate files) for various NOS

***Status:** This is a Draft BCOP in need of further development.*
