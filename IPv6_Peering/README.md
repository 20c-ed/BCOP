# BCOP - IPv6 Peering

This BCOP aims to provide general IPv6 Peering and Transit guidelines that can be followed by any network operator when planning and implementing any IPv6 Peering/Transit relationship. The primary focus is on understanding BGP peering and filtering.

We (the GNEC) have made many mistakes with IPv4 Peering and Transit configurations and operational practices. As operators begin turning up more and more IPv6 E-BGP sessions with peers and transit providers, there is an opportunity to do things right from the beginning. While the details of these peering and transit relationships can be varied and specific, the technical realities remain largely the same. These technical realities inform the best practices listed here.

***Status:** This is a Draft BCOP in need of further development.*
