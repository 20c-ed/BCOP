# BCOP - DDoS / DoS Response

This BCOP aims to be a guide of practices that have proven effective in production network environments of what to do before, during and after a DDoS/DoS attack. These practices are based on experiences and tactics that have worked satisfactorily.

NANOG members have faced, and continue to deal with Denial of Service attacks in their network infrastructure. Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks’ main purpose is to take a significant toll on a network’s role and capacity to serve and satisfy its intended purpose. As these DDoS/DoS attacks continue to grow in quantity while becoming more sophisticated, network operators find themselves being willing or unwillingly, Attack defenders. An informal measure of this involvement is the number of DDoS/DoS attack-related discussions and perspectives shared in NANOG forums. This BCOP is the result of as a grass-roots effort to gather and disseminate relevant, collective best practices in order to assist network operators in becoming more effective DoS attack defenders. While specific details of DDoS/DoS attacks often do vary, these DDoS/DoS Attack Mitigation Best Common Operational Practices present common specific recommendations and concise information to network operators for DDoS/DoS mitigation.

***Status:** This is a Draft BCOP in need of further development.*
