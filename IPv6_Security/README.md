# BCOP - IPv6 Security (Myths)

Even all these years into deployment, some common and recurring misconceptions about security in IPv6 remain. 

After a presentation on this topic, several members of the GNEC requested more formally documenting these realities as a BCOP.

This is a very early draft that simply copies the presentation text into the BCOP format. 

Next steps should include adding context at least, and converting to give advice for best practices on how to deal with all of these issues (versus merely pointing them out) at most (i.e. drop the "Myths" part and just offer advice)...

***Status:** This is a Draft BCOP and needs further development.*
