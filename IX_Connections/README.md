# BCOP - IX Connections
This document describes the physical and network components that comprise the best current operational practices for connecting to a public peering exchange point. It also provides general configuration parameters and guidelines, but does not include vendor-specific configuration information.

There are a multitude of exchange points around the world each of which has a set of independent providers using a common exchange fabric to connect and pass traffic to one another. Although there are always specific configuration requirements for particular exchange points, there are also common configuration parameters that, if used, will add to the stability of any exchange. This BCOP lays out the guidelines that should apply in most situations, providing a foundation for ￼Exchange-specific requirements, but not superseding them. The specific rules of any exchange must be ￼followed even when contrary to the guidelines specified in the BCOP document.

**Status:** This document *possibly a different version* was ratified as a BCOP at the IPBCOP session of NANOG 54 on February 6, 2012.
